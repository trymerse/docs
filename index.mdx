# Documentation
Get started with the Merse API.

## API Overview

</div>

Learn how to use the Merse API. Everything can be done with your Dashboard (other than logging events), but for API access, you'll need to generate an access key.

## Authentication
To get an access key, go to your Merse workspace, settings, and then generate an access key. 

The access key is then sent as a header in your requests.

## Third Party API Clients

We don't maintain any Third Party API Clients. If you want to create your own, we would happily link to it here!
